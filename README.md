# 🖥️ Custom TUI Dashboard

A high-performance Terminal User Interface (TUI) dashboard built with Go and Bubbletea. It centralizes your daily workflow by combining real-time system resource monitoring, interactive Docker container management, and live GitHub notification tracking into a single command-line tool, ensuring your hands never have to leave the keyboard.

## ✨ Features

### 📊 System Monitoring
* **Real-time Metrics:** Monitor CPU, Memory, Disk, and Network throughput updated every second.
* **Visualizations:** Sparkline graphs for historical trend visualization and color-coded gauges (Green to Red based on usage).
* **Non-blocking:** Background workers poll data without blocking the UI thread.

### 🐳 Docker Management
* **Container Control:** View all running and stopped containers with color-coded statuses.
* **Quick Actions:** Start, stop, or restart containers instantly using keyboard shortcuts.
* **Log Streaming:** Dedicated log viewer to stream the last 20 lines of container logs.
* **Graceful Handling:** Smart detection and clear error messaging if the Docker daemon is unavailable.

### 🐙 GitHub Notifications
* **Live Tracking:** View unread notifications categorized by type (PR, Issue, Release, Mention) with clear icons.
* **Interactive Management:** Mark notifications as read, open them directly in your OS web browser, or filter by repository using fuzzy search.
* **Secure:** Authenticates via your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT).

### ⌨️ Global UI & Navigation
* **Vim-Style Bindings:** Use `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` to navigate lists and scroll.
* **Tabbed Views:** Quickly switch between System, Docker, and GitHub views using numbers `1`, `2`, `3` or `Tab` / `Shift+Tab`.
* **Responsive:** Adapts automatically to terminal window resizing.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Go 1.21 or later
* Docker daemon running (for the Docker module)
* A terminal with 256-color support

### Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository and build the binary:**
 ```bash
         go build -o bin/dashboard ./cmd/dashboard/main.go
 ```
